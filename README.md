# NetPractice ðŸ“¡

## Introduction
- This project is part of a series of exercises designed to help **practice networking concepts and TCP/IP addressing.** In this project, I configure small-scale networks and complete 10 levels (exercises).

## GRADE PROJECT âœ…
- 100/100 ðŸ“‹
- [**Subject**](https://github.com/nunovaladao/42_netpractice_lev4/blob/main/extras/en.subject.pdf)

## Installation
To get started with NetPratice, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository via
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/nunovaladao/42_NetPractice_lev4.git
```

2. Move into the repository directory:
```bash
cd 42_NetPractice_lev4
```

## Evaluation Exercices
The assessment is done with `3 random levels` in which we only have `15 minutes` to solve the `3 exercises`.

## Some Topics

- **`IP Addressing:`** IP (Internet Protocol) addressing is a system used to uniquely identify devices on a network. It assigns a numerical label (IP address) to each device, allowing data to be routed and delivered to the correct destination.
    - ***`Ex:`*** Think of an IP address like a postal address for a house. Just as a house has a unique address to receive mail, devices on a network have unique IP addresses to send and receive data. For example, an IPv4 address might look like 192.168.1.1.

- **`Subnetting:`** Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks or subnets. It helps optimize IP address allocation and improve network organization.
    - ***`Ex:`*** Imagine you have a large office building with many departments. Subnetting is like dividing the building into floors or sections, each with its own address. For instance, you can divide a network into subnets like 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24, making it easier to manage and control traffic within each section.

- **`Routing:`** Routing involves the selection of the best path for data to travel from one network to another. Routers make routing decisions based on network routing tables and protocols, ensuring data reaches its intended destination efficiently.
    - ***`Ex:`*** Routing is like a GPS system finding the best route for your trip. When data travels between networks, routers determine the most efficient path. If you want to send data from your home network (192.168.1.0/24) to a website (e.g., 203.0.113.1), routers along the way ensure it reaches the destination correctly, like guiding your GPS to take the fastest route.


## Conclusion

Understanding IP addressing, subnetting, and routing is fundamental to effectively managing and optimizing computer networks. IP addressing gives unique identities to devices, much like postal addresses for homes. Subnetting allows us to organize and manage networks efficiently, just like dividing a large building into sections. Routing ensures that data finds its way from one network to another, similar to a GPS guiding us along the best route.

By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks, ensuring data flows smoothly and securely. Whether you're a network administrator, engineer, or enthusiast, a solid grasp of IP addressing, subnetting, and routing is a valuable asset in the world of networking.
